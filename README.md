Service Request Form:
Phase #1
Would allow clients and or prospective clients to contact a small business directly. I am creating this this as a service request form for a small business. This form will be used by clients who want or need service/maintenance to their existing electronic security system and would like to schedule a repair or service. The company is a low voltage system integrator who specializes in electronic security. They would then receive the email and confirm the service request being scheduled.

Phase #2
Would allow the business to confirm and immediately send a reply via email, SMS messaging and or notification (if app is created). I plan to further automate the process of ticket generation with status updates.
